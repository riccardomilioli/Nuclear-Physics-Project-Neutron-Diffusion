# Nuclear-Physics-Project-Neutron-Diffusion
The uploaded scripts perform an analysis of the neutron diffusion equation following the paper 'Neutron Diffusion' by Griffiths. <br/>
Files with the number 3, 4 and 5 and 6 should go together with the Mathematica notebook file that has the same number. In particular file 4 reads data from 'integral_results.txt', a text file exported from the Mathematica script with number 4. <br/>
If the Matlab file doesn't run it's because it only accepts file whose name start with a letter.
